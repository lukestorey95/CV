## <a name="about_me">What I'm about</a>

Hi I'm Luke and I'm a hungry Software Engineer who has recently completed Makers Academy and is looking to bring my passion for learning, understanding of solid engineering principles, rigorous testing and methodological debugging to an exciting new role.

I have a background as an entrepreneur (pizza-preneur), and recent experience at a tech company going above and beyond my role by optimising longstanding business processes, collaborating with product managers and engineers on new feature releases and improving bug resolution and testing across the company.

My biggest strength (and occaisional weakness) is my desire to learn new things, whether it be figuring out a new technology, planning the best solution to a problem. I am highly self reliant, but perform my best when surrounded by a team all working towards a shared goal.

I am proficient across various languages, frameworks and data systems, but am always interested in picking up new technologies.

## <a name="skills">What I'm great at (skills)</a>

### Entrepreneurship 

After graduating university and being inspired by my love of food, I set up and ran my own pizza making business. I built and trademarked a brand, learnt how to market my product, trained staff, managed inventory and flipped many a pizza. I was hired by a number of clients for parties, events and even secured a place at a London Christmas market across the winter period. This was a non stop year of learning, and despite the long hours, financial pressure and constant deadlines, I absolutely loved every minute. I learnt so much about myself, how to be self reliant, and how to just get things done even when you have no idea where to start.

<br>

### Project Management

During my time at notonthehighstreet I was always on the look out for extra projects I could take on to continue my learning and make myself stand out within the company. One such project I pitched was to improve the review response rate for purchased products. I layed out the business case and explained the positive impact it would have on conversion rate, provided timeframe estimates and explained the cost and any potential risks. I collaborated with the legal, finance, operations, marketing and design teams as well as external providers and ultimately doubled the response rate overnight upon completion of the project.

### Leadership

Another example of going above and beyond was when I took on a project in support of a new feature release to help retail partners manage their inventory. We had a strict timeframe to persuade a large percentage of partners to use the new system, so I hired and trained a team to support me and set up an outreach program where we would talk through the benefits of the new functionality and offer support in making the switch. I made sure the relevant stakeholders were updated throughout the process, ensured the team were kept motivated and productive throughout. I learnt a lot about managing a team whilst also ensuring the project ran to schedule, and it really highlighted how much I enjoy having goals to strive for and a team to motivate along the way.

## <a name="interests">What I love to do (interests)</a>

- Cycling - I can't always be having a coding breakthrough, so getting out on my bike and feeling the wind in my hair is the next best thing and brings me a lot of joy

- Climbing - I have recently picked up bouldering, and can't help but draw comparisons with debugging a tricky bit of code. You have to step back, think through all your options and then keep trying different things until you get to the top
  
- Pizza - Despite no longer making pizza professionally I still love to host a pizza party or two, and count myself as an avid foodie (ask me about my dough spreadsheet or V60 recipe if you dare)
