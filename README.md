## <a name="about_me"></a>

Hi I'm Luke and I'm a hungry Software Engineer who has recently completed Makers Academy and is looking to bring my passion for learning, understanding of solid engineering principles, rigorous testing and methodological debugging to an exciting new role.

I have a background as an entrepreneur, and recent experience at a tech company going above and beyond my role by optimising longstanding business processes, collaborating with product managers and engineers on new feature releases and improving bug resolution and testing across the company.

My biggest strength is my desire to always be learning something new, figuring out a new technology or planning the best solution to a problem. I am highly self reliant, but perform my best when surrounded by a team all working towards a shared goal.

I am proficient across various languages, frameworks and data systems, but am always interested in picking up new technologies.

### Entrepreneurship 

  After graduating university and being inspired by my love of pizza, I decided to set up and run my own business. I built and trademarked a brand, learnt how to market my product and attract clients, and trained staff to support with large events. I was hired by a number of clients for parties, events and secured a place at a local Christmas market for several months. This was a non stop year of learning, and despite the long hours, continuous pressure and constant deadlines, I absolutely loved every minute. 

<!-- - Experience
